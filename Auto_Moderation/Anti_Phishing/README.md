# Anti Phishing
<!---The code will no longer get updated due to the list getting to long and there being other alternatives such as using the Fish bot.  -->
### I once had custom commands for anti phishing but since we keep adding many domains and YAGPDB now has anti phishing/scam built in this project is abandoned  

YAGPDB now has anti phishing built into it as a native feature.  
You can activate it by going to `Tools & Utilities` > `Basic Automoderator` > `Banned Websites` and turning on `Enable Scam link protection`.  
Make sure you also turn on the module itself and basic automoderator.  
For automod v2 you can create a rule with the trigger `Flagged Scam Links`, which will then also detect scam links.  



The following bots currently use the api that will protect you even against brand new phishing links:
