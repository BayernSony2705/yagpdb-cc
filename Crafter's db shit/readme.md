# THIS README IS WORK IN PROGRESS

Hello,
thanks for using my database custom commands.

There are 3 folders inside of this one.
Basic - All database commands you need for masic things like dbset dbdel
dbreset - All database commands that do mass deletion of entries
dbmap - All database commands that have to do with saved sdicts in the dbvalue


What you can change:
In all commands there are a few variables you can change at the top of each command such as the timezone and permissions. 

All commands can be named after the file names.

What are dbmaps?
If you like saving stuff in the database you might run across sdict and that you can save stuff via {{dbSet 1234 "test" (sdict "tree" "big" "house" "huge" "your mum" "gay")}}. Now you can use dballmap 1234 test to view all available names like tree house and your mum. 

What does reset do?
with the reset commands like dbresetall, dbresetkey and dbresetuser you can mass delete database entries. There will be a confirmation you can't miss before you accidentally delete shit.


If you have any more questions you can contact me via my Discord.
