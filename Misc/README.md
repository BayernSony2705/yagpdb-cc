### Mute Checker  
With this code you can check if a role (your muted role) is set up right in every channel and which channels might have issues.  
It will give you a list of channels that the user will be able to speak in because of the channel permissions and a list of all roles that can still speak in that channel when the user is muted.  
The code has 2 modes:  
`$yagmute := false` - this will just give the user the role you gave it in the command and then check the permissions  
`$yagmute := true` - this will execute the yagpdb mute command. This should be used if you have setup yagpdb to take away roles on mute. When you use this mode you cannot input a role in the command anymore and it will auto detect yagpdb's mute role.
