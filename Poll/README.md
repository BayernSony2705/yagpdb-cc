# Poll Custom Command

## ❗DISCLAMER❗
When single mode is used the poll does not have an infinite capacity of reactions that can be stored!  
The max is about **<u>XXX</u>** reactions.  
There is no protection against people spam clicking reactions when set to single mode. YAGPDB is limited now how many reactions it can remove one by one.

## How to set it up:
Disable the inbuilt poll custom command with command overwrites and after that add the custom commands.  
If you don't know how to disable the default poll command look at this gif that shows how to disable commands.

## What is so special about this custom command?
When adding `-single` anywhere in the trigger you can force people to only choose one reaction and whenever a user reacts on 2 reactions his old reaction will be removed.
