## License  

You do not have to include [the full license](LICENSE) in the code because it is too long. That's why I made [this small text](#small-license-text) that has to stay in the code.  
If [that license](#small-license-text) can not be found in the code on this repository, you can do whatever you want with the code and I won't even care if you claim you made it.

## üí©Wall of shameüí©

<sub> I hate to see when people just remove the copyright from code and think that is perfectly fine. I have created this GitHub repo because I wanted to share my cool ideas I had to the community. And going ahead and ripping someones name from their code or even replacing it with their own is unaccaptable. For that I created this wall of shame and if you find yourself here you should know that you are the reason I hate to publish my code online and that I would share more stuff if you wouldn't have been such an asshole.  
Everybody that gets added here is blocked by me and I will refuse to help them with anything and other voluntary helpers are also notified about someone being added here.</sub>
