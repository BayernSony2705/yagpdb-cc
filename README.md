**I am new to github / never really created a repo before so this is my first time so don't judge if i do something wrong.**

##### Important:
Remember that you can get update notifications for my custom commands if you join my [discord server](/https://discord.gg/GRns3f) and __follow__ my announcement channel or give yourself the role that pings you for any updates  
  
If you visited this repo without knowing about [my website](https://www.thehdcraftergaming.tk/yagpdb) and my [discord server](/https://discord.gg/GRns3f) it would be nice if you could check it out. *There you can also find more stuff and code that is not shown here on github ;)*  
Thank you :)
