**I am new to github / never really created a repo before so this is my first time so don't judge if i do something wrong.**

##### My website:
If you visited this repo without knowing about [my website](https://www.thehdcraftergaming.tk/yagpdb) you should probably check it out because I explain my custom commands with pictures, a description and the trigger and trigger type there.

---
##### Other custom command repositories:
[Joe's Repo](https://github.com/jo3-l/yagpdb-cc): This is the biggest repo of custom commands I know of.  
[Pedros Repo](https://github.com/Pedro-Pessoa/yagpdb-cc/tree/Tickets/tickets): A fork of Joe's repo but with an amazing ticket system.
